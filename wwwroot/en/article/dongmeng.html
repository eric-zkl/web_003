                        <p>In January 9, 2014, Guangxi held a working conference on the comprehensive financial reform pilot area in Nanning. Since Guangxi started the comprehensive financial reform along the border in 2014, China's first ASEAN monetary service platform, the first RMB and Vietnamese Shield franchise business pilot projects have landed in Dongxing, the local people get rid of the RMB and Vietnamese Shield exchange rate "apportionment bank" pricing.</p>
                        <p>Dongxing and Vietnam's Manjie market are facing each other across the river. It is the only port city between China and ASEAN. In recent years, the city has implemented a series of "pilot-ahead" financial reform measures, and created a number of "Guangxi first" and "China first". More and more enterprises engaged in Sino-Vietnamese trade and border people have benefited substantially.
In September 13, 2017, the Ninth China ASEAN financial cooperation and development forum was held in Nanning, Guangxi. Finance is the core of modern economy. In the past five years, Guangxi has accelerated the pace of financial opening up, deepened its financial cooperation with ASEAN, and made remarkable innovations in financial reform along the border, moving towards a "deep-water zone". According to the data provided by Guangxi Finance Office, by the end of April this year, the total cross-border RMB settlement in Guangxi amounted to 86.97 billion yuan, ranking first among China's eight border provinces (regions).</p>
                        <p>Since the financial and trade platform of China-ASEAN (Chongzuo) regional financial service center was commissioned in April 2017, the monthly transaction amount has exceeded 200 million yuan, which has solved the bottleneck problem of enterprise development and made the small and medium-sized enterprises save more time, energy and labor in trade. In the view of Yu Shanglin, chairman of Guangxi Yida Real Estate Investment Co., Ltd., it will be of great significance to promote foreign trade by the financial reform along the border. </p>
