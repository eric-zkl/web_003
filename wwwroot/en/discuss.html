                <p>This is the contest of “Learning the Report of the 19th National Congress of the Eight-Year Youth League”. Young people are the future of the motherland and the heirs of the nation. They will determine the fate of the motherland. Looking back 40 years ago, the older generation of revolutionaries led the people to rise from the predicament with great fearless spirit and created a historical monument to the rejuvenation. Today, 40 years later, China's development faces unprecedented opportunities and faces unprecedented challenges. Today, when we look back on the unforgettable years of 40 years, we must fully understand the great significance and great achievements of reform and opening up, and learn from the passion of reform and the power of development. We must strengthen our own ideas and shoulder the heavy responsibilities of the times. The strength of youth social responsibility will be related to the process of building a well-off society in an all-round way. It is related to whether or to what extent we can shoulder the historical mission of realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.</p>

                <h1>Talking about the fruits of development</h1>
                <p>Recently, the Office of the Party Committee of the Autonomous Region held a symposium on retirees “seeing 60 years of development in Guangxi, new achievements in reform and opening up”, and more than 50 retired veteran comrades attended the forum. Shao Qixian, deputy inspector of the Office of the Party Committee of the Autonomous Region, presided over the meeting.</p>
                <p>At the symposium, veteran comrades combined their own experiences, from the perspectives of people's livelihood improvement, economic development, transportation construction, poverty alleviation, foreign exchanges, strict governance of the party, anti-corruption and honesty, etc., and detailed 40 years of reform and opening up and 60 years since the establishment of the autonomous region. Great changes have taken place in all aspects of clothing, food, housing, transportation and education, health care, and health. Everyone agrees that the Chinese people’s pockets are getting more and more drums, their lives are getting better and better, their travels are getting more and more convenient, their waists are getting harder and harder, and the Chinese nation has ushered in a great leap from standing up, getting rich and strengthening, from being closed and old. To reform and opening up, from poverty alleviation to prosperity and prosperity, from the edge of the world to the center of the world stage, from the search for the Chinese plan... The road to socialism with Chinese characteristics is self-confident, theoretically confident, institutionally confident, and culturally confident. Resolutely, the political ecology of the party’s internal atmosphere is gradually manifested, and the sense of gain, happiness and satisfaction of the masses have significantly improved.</p>

                        <p>Adhering to the people-centered development thinking, we must integrate the major deployments of the 19th National Congress with the development strategy of Guangxi, and integrate the goals of “three major positioning” and “two completions” in our district. One thing Then one thing will be done, one year after another, and every small goal, medium goal, and big goal of the Eight Gui children will become a reality in the new era.</p>

                        <p>We must unswervingly implement the principle of strictly administering the party strictly, not forgetting the initial intention, continuing to advance, and continuously enhancing the creativity, cohesiveness and combat effectiveness of party organizations at all levels, and giving full play to the core role of the party's leadership. The fourth party congress of the city, while portraying the blueprint for the development of Hechi in the next five years, also pointed out the key to achieving the grand goal.</p>
